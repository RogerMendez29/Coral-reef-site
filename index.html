            <p>I'm excited to start my journey in the world of software developing, ive had a few friends who have recommended a boot camp
                for a while now and after researching a few Ive enrolled in Flatiron School. This is a whole different carreer path for
                as I come from a background in biology. 
            </p>
            <p>As I am an avid Scuba Diver and am mesmorized by coral reefs, this website will outline in my opinion the top five coral reefs to scuba dive in the world. 
               Hopefully it will give you a reason to further preserve our oceans by recycling, reducing and reusing.
